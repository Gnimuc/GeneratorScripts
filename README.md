# GeneratorScripts

This project is mainly for monitoring the compatibility of the code generated by Clang.jl's binding generator.

All of the code in this repository are released under those licenses in the corresponding Julia projects, respectively.

In general, it's OK to treat these scripts as examples on how to use Clang.jl, but not for any other purposes.
